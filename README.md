##About
###You are helping an aspiring chef! problem is that the chef is not very bright and does not understand how a restaurant works. They acquired some industrial conveyor belts and are using them to send food out without taking orders from customers or even checking if the customers are even there. As the night goes on the chef gets more and more motivated and will start putting out more and more dishes.
You can use "FAME" to get customers to eat at the restaurant, if a dish reaches the end of the conveyor and falls into the bin the chef will get sad, if too many dishes fall into the bin in a short period of time, the chef will pack up for the night.
The goal of the game is to hold out against the chefs comical motivation as long as you can!
